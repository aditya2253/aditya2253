➡ I caught fire coding.

➡ I always thought my dream was to be a professional athlete or a gamer as that's what I mostly spent my childhood on. Then suddenly I turned 18 and gave JEE and went to college for my plan B. I was settling in college life and giving exams just to pass the semesters. But I kind of just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different.

➡ And that's when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I clicked play on my first Python tutorial video. (I mean seriously, how could it not be great when it's named after Monty Python's Flying Circus?) Since then, I can't get enough. Programming and developing calls to all of my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code (in a separate Git branch, of course).

➡ My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, web development and doing all the things while staying calm and executing them well. So far I have C++, C#, React, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, and Git/GitHub under my belt. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
